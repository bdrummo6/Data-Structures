    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the JS `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?
        
       - The runtime complexity of doubly linked list's `delete` has a runtime complexity of O(1). The worst case 
         runtime complexity of JS `Array.splice` method is O(n). Doubly linked list's `delete` function generally 
         performs better.
